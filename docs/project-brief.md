# RAG PDF Project Brief

## Executive Summary

The RAG PDF project is an intelligent document analysis and question-answering system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to enable natural language interaction with PDF documents. Designed specifically for Thai language processing with multilingual support, this system transforms static PDF documents into interactive knowledge bases that users can query conversationally.

## Project Vision

To democratize PDF document access and understanding through AI-powered conversational interfaces, making information extraction more intuitive and efficient for Thai users while maintaining support for multiple languages.

## Problem Statement

Traditional PDF documents present significant challenges for information retrieval and understanding:

1. **Static Format**: PDFs are designed for presentation, not data extraction
2. **Language Barriers**: Thai language processing requires specialized tokenization and models
3. **Information Overload**: Large documents make finding specific information difficult
4. **Multi-modal Content**: PDFs contain both text and images that are typically processed separately
5. **Accessibility**: Users need technical skills to extract and analyze PDF content effectively

## Solution Overview

Our RAG PDF system addresses these challenges through:

- **Multi-modal Processing**: Simultaneous extraction and analysis of text and images
- **Thai Language Optimization**: Specialized models and tokenization for Thai text
- **Semantic Search**: Context-aware retrieval based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language Q&A through an intuitive web interface
- **Intelligent Context**: Automatic summarization and context augmentation for better answers

## Target Users

### Primary Users:
- **Students**: Research and study assistance for academic PDFs
